		<h1>Bowie and Jaz Forever</h1>
			<p>Meet <strong><em>Bowie,</em></strong> a three year old male 'spanador' (half labrador, half cocker spaniel). If you hadn't guessed, Jasmin is a bit of a David Bowie fan. (She is a fan of a lot of things, but dogs and David Bowie are up there. See below list of further <a href="#fan">'Things Jaz is a fan of'</a>) </p><p>Bowie Mayfield the spanador recently had an operation to remove a large cyst from his throat. Here's a wee pic of the two of them after surgery.</p>

		<h2>Bowie and The Fox</h2>
			<p>In a perfect world Bowie and "The Fox" would be best mates and play really well together. Currently young Master Fox Mayfield (all of age 1.5) entertains himself by chasing Bowie with a frog stick with wheels and smacking him in the face. Then laughing. Aside from being a physical toddler, he's a pretty cool little guy. <br>I reserved him a domain name some time ago, you can see it <a href="http://foxmayfield.com" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>


		<h3 id="fan">Things that Jaz is a fan of:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Dumplings, especially pan-fried chive dumplings</li>
				<li>Bright coloured lipsticks, generally of the MAC variety</li>
				<li>Sunny days, specifically with sunshine ONNNN her (she's cold-blooded - could never live in Iceland for example)</li>
				<li>Cowboy boots, Texas BBQ, saying y'all (and being a wannabe Texan)</li>
				<li style="color:#1A4876"><em> See below cowboy boots. Click on the image to buy yours online</em></li>
			</ul>

		<h4>A short list of foods that Jaz won't eat. She will eat absolutely, anything and everything else:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Fennel (Ewwww!!)</li>
				<li>Coriander (Help me Rhonda!)</li>
				<li>Frogs (MEGA VOMMIT!!!!!)</li>
			</ol>
	
		<h5>I want to eat pizza. So bad.</h5>
			<p>Currently Jaz is doing Jason Vale's <em><strong><a href="http://www.superjuiceme.com/">Super Juice Me!</a></strong></em> juice detox. Wish her luck. She's only on day 3 and could kill for some pan fried chive dumplings right now.</p>
