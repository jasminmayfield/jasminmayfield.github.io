			<h2>Thinking and Learning = Dumplings and Soy Sauce?</h2><br>

			<h3>"FREE YOUR MIIIIIIND. THE REST WILL FOLLOW" (JavaScript looping especially!...)
			 </h3>

			 <p>This exercise is all about connecting with my inner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Anthony_Gregorc.27s_model" target="_blank">Gregorc Thinking style.</a> I'm kinda excited! So it all started a few weeks back when we had to take a quiz to dive deep into "what is our thinking style". Here's some pics of my doodlings and subsequent discovery of my Gregorc Thinking Style:</p>. 

			 <img width=850px; src="images/thinkingstyle.jpg"/>

			 <p>So yes. I'm what's called an <strong><em>Abstract Random thinker.</em></strong></p>
			 <p>Here's a few points on what this means.</p>
				<ol class="reasons_list">
					<li><strong>About.</strong> Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection.</li>
					<li><strong>And..?</strong> We tend to thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments (rings very true for me FACT!).</li>
					<li><strong>Another fact about us.</strong> We, the "Abstract Random thinking folk" constitute about 30% of the population.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>So I've done some research into this. It's pretty interesting. Don't judge me, but have a read though <a href="http://www.cgribben.com/psych/ar.html" target="_blank">here.</a> If you're time-poor here's a quick summary of all the great and ugly points about myself below:</p>
				<ul class="reasons_list">
					<li>You are a master of unusual organization systems that nobody else can understand.</li>
					<li>You experience big emotional swings and are very sensitive.</li>
					<li>You are person oriented.</li>
					<li>You are very creative and divergent.</li>
					<li>You take being challenged personally and are likely to just "shut down". </li>
					<li><strong>Best Career Choices: Marketing, the Arts and Research and Development.</strong> Hmmmm. Uh-oh..!</li>
				</ul>

				<p>And here's a table that goes into this a bit further:</p>
				<div class="extra_photos"><img src="http://s23.postimg.org/5anzxxytn/tspic.png"/></div>

				<p>Chanelling this, here's (another) (very short!!) list of actionable points that I can put into play to assist with my learning here at EDA. I'm hoping to further grow this list over time.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>"My ideas grow better with a friend" mentality. I need to embrace pair programming and not be afraid to work with others. This will help me.</li>
					<li>AR's like to use their creativity – “I know what you want, but can I do it my way?”. I need to allocate time to build stuff myself, be creative and learn rather than being bogged down in readings and challenges (this is really a time management thing). I'm planning on building a couple of things at the end of phase 0 when we have 2 weeks revision time.</li>
				</ol>			

		
			
			<h3>MY COMMENTS ON GROWTH/FIXED MINDSET</h3>
			<p>Here's some short and sharp comments, in no particular order on how I can apply this mindset to my learning and untimately my success at EDA:</p>
			<ol class="reasons_list">
				<li><strong>Stop being negative, embrace the challenge.</strong> Feeling challenged is all about learning and being negative is counter-productive to this. Yes I'm going to feel like a lemon and out of my depth doing this course but I am physically and emotionally moulding my brain to stretch and accommodate all this new-found learning. This is all about attitude ad the right one to have is a positive one.</li>

				<li><strong>If I want to be a front-end designer...</strong> I need to put the effort in. Time and effort lead to the path to mastery, as worded so well by Carol S. Dweck, That's what I want to be. So all these hours, all these king-sized block of chocolates. Totes worth it in the end.</li>
				<li><strong>Strong mind.</strong> I have to stop feeling like I want to give in and die everytime I hit an intensely hard challenge. I have found myself over the last week jumping in and out of this space - moreso the recovery is definately improving and I have become so much more persistent in working through bugs etc.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Yes. This has been a pretty insightful blog and really valuable time given to exploring my thinking style and the impact it has on my hopeful next steps as a front-end designer. So thinking and learning = dumplings and soy sauce?<br>
			The answer for me is yes. Yes yes yes. If you're an Abstract Thinker, you'll know what I mean.
