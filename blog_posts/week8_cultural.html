			<h2>Handling Conflict and the Compass of Shame</h2>

			<h4 class="stand_out">
			Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
			What was the source of the conflict? How did you handle that conflict?
			Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
			If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
			What did you learn from this experience?
			</h4>


			<h3>Being assertive with bullet-points</h3>
			<ul class="reasons_list">
				<li>A time I felt emotionally conflicted was when an HR matter was poorly dealt with and I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. The hard-place was my manager, who was negligent and extremely unprofessional in contract handling a very loyal and long-standing employee on my team. The hard-place was my own personal ethics and values vs business priorities.</li>
				<li>People being fired/managed out for all sorts of wonderful reasons was at an all time high in this business environment. </li>
				<li>My most senior team member was approved extended annual leave however while the team member was on said leave (getting maried and taking a honeymoon) my manager's mind changed and suddenly she didn't want her back on the team.</li>
				<li>Some strange things happened. I had to run above said team member's division. I was required to train others about my role (but wasn't able to hand my work over to anyone).</li>
				<li>I felt dreadful because the poor girl was going to be fired and had no idea, and somehow I seemed to be taking her job, without officially being offered it (had this been the case I would have flatly said no)</li>
				<li>In my eyes this wasn't a fair or reasonable position for anyone. Professionalism aside (or in this case, "lack of") it heavily went against the grain of my own personal ethical values.</li>
				<li>The physical toll on my body started to weigh in - I was doing my role, her role and then training others, working with everything I had, I became a psycho workaholic really doing 3 jobs for no extra pay. Coffee helped.</li>
				<li>Family time was scarce with Fox in daycare for the max time allowed (50 hours a week), I got really fat and unhealthy eating poorly and seemingly had no time to really look after myself. It was all about the business with nothing for me. I was like a robot!</li>
				<li>In context of all the firing that was going on I was pretty scared of my manager. Referring to the <a target="_blank" href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf"/><em> Compass of Shame,</em></a> my actions were a combination of "attack other" and largely "avoidance". When I stood up for my team my views were dismissed and exhanged with mountains of work. I respect the chain of command but I found it easier to withdraw and avoid my manager, who in my eyes didn't make time to really listen, which meant she didn't have an accurate grip on the situation, especially on staff morale.</li>
				<li>These actions resulted in further pressures from my manager, so avoidance wasn't helping, but I honestly didn't know what would help. Certainly being vocal and standing up for my team member didn't help, and the expectation was that I could continue running a functional business juggling three jobs and that I should be quiet and let her deal with it. </li>
				<li>Looking back retrospectively, what would I do differently? What have I learnt? I probably should have left sooner. I ended up resigning with 1 month's notice (that turned into 7 months). When I look back I know I gave every part of myself to my job and in a lot of ways I'm really proud of what I achieved during my tenure there. Huge amounts of professional growth and advancement not to mention personal development. The bad points were a lack of life balance and just being caught in the daily grind, feeling like I wasn't adding value, that I was a bad person who should have stood up more for her beliefs. Bototm line though - it would be a long hard road to try and "fix" things. It was a business that I didn't want to be a part of anymore because it went against my ethics as a person. I want to be part of a team that feels empowered and supported.</li>
