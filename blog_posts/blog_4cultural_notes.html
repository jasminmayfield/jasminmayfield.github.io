{ "We don't need no education" => "Remove them bricks from the wall" } 

Pink Floyd. We all know the tune. Some say the wall represents a departure from society. (It's badass).
It's actually a really great metaphor for what's happening with educating women in the tech world and rather putting bricks in walls and creating a divide, the industry is doing the exact opposite. It's highly self conscious. It's removing bricks from walls to provide women access and easy, simple ways seems to dive in. 

 At the time of writing this blog, Google was simultaneously launching a $50 million initiative
 called <em>Made with Code</em> which is aimed at recruiting more women to work as coders. The name <em>Made with Code</em> is a rewrite of the phrase <em>Made with Love,</em> where all  craftsy, domestic, child-bearing associations are essentially extended to include the notion of 'code' and 'tech', largely foreign turf for 80% of the working female population. While this historically may be  the case, Google's phrase <em>Made with Code</em> is affirming that coding can be just as much as natural discipline to women as it is to men. This is an initiative about inclusion (and smart marketing). It's the start of something really big in terms of the industry and with the efforts of such programmes by Google, and more close to home - Dev Academy Bootcamp, I think there will be a definate uptake (potentially explosion?) of female developers in the world. 

Here's a few hard and fast realities: 

<ul>
	<li>Gender disparity is a dire issue for all tech companies.</li>
	<li>Only 20% of women hold a STEM qualification(science, technology, engineering, mathematics)</li>
	<li>While 57 percent of occupations in the workforce are held by women, in computing occupations that figure is only 25 percent.</li>
	<li>Of chief information officer jobs (CIOs) at Fortune 250 companies, 20 percent were held by a woman in 2012.</li>
	<li>Research shows that [women’s] choices impact up to 85 percent of purchasing decisions. By some analyses, they account for $4.3 trillion of total U.S. consumer spending of $5.9 trillion, making women the largest single economic force not just in the United States, but in the world.</li>
	<li>Only 3 percent of tech startups are formed by women (Kauffman Foundation).</li>
	<li>The computing industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the U.S., and in the past year there was a 3.5 percent increase in software services jobs, vastly outpacing population growth of 0.9 percent. There are so many open jobs in the technology sector that many technology companies are unable to fill current openings. They worry about expanding in the future and being able to fill future needs. At current graduation rates, only 30 percent of the jobs created by 2020 can be filled with U.S. computing graduates.</li>
	<li>Bigger picture stuff - there's already a shortage of developers in the world. How can innovation and growth be sustained if demand is high but supply is low?</li>
	<li>12% of computer-science degrees go to women, and in order for Silicon Valley to survive and thrive, it has to recruit what it can (i.e. males, male dominated industry.</li>
	<li>In 2012, 20% of women held a STEM qualiication (STEM referring to the disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So one fifth.</li>
	<li>Our world remains reliant on STEM, but those engaged in its development continue to be dominated by men.</li>
	<li>The UK Council of Professors and Heads of Computing conservatively predicts that demand for IT professionals will increase by up to 15% in the next eight years.</li>
	<li>Software development is one of the top five most in-demand jobs globally.  Big data alone could create around 4.4 million jobs by 2015 but only one-third of these positions will be filled. Meanwhile, the number of students aiming for jobs in the industry has fallen by 50% since 2001.</li>
	<li>The tech 

</ul>

There will be 1.4 million computing jobs available in 2020, but only 400,000 computer-science graduates from U.S. universities to fill them. 

 


			Building a better internet and improving software to better service society as a whole. 

			This year there are six million information technology jobs in the US, up from 628,600 in 1987, then 1.34 million in 1997. Right now, jobs in technology have half the unemployment rate of the rest of the workforce. There is no sign this will change anytime soon. If growth continues at the current rate, it will not be long until women will not be able to sustain themselves if not involved in a technical field. 

We have to start educating young girls about this now, or they may ultimately become the poorest demographic among us. Quote this source: http://www.quora.com/Women-in-Technology-1/Why-do-we-need-more-women-in-technology

			Digital economy - exponential growth. IT skill shortage. This is not good for business. NZ context - offers economic opportunities. Hotly debated topic.

			shortage of software developers has impact on ability to grow, to export, to advance. 

			elephant in the room = gender equality: Because more women in tech now will encourage more girls to pursue their own interest in tech (and will therefore enable greater equality).
Take a 15-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy with equal interest and capabilities for tech careers. The girl will be surrounded by images that tell her "hey, tech isn't for people like you." The girl will likely be discouraged from pursuing tech even though she's just as interested and capable as the boys. That's is a lack of equal access, although a more subtle form than just outright discrimination.

It's also possible to grow innovation in areas not hugely explored i.e. materniy markets - breast pump technology, ovulation tracking tools. While there is a fair bit of this stuff happening in the apps world it could be improved. so tech industry is making less impact in these fields as most guys dont really swing this way. 

Having more women in tech now will mean more female tech leaders and more girls thinking, "hey, this is for me." More people will be able to do what they want, and that's a good thing.

			As the software development skills shortage intensifies, many western organisations are also offshoring positions at developing country wages to plug this gap and to avoid paying inflated salaries for domestic employees. However, this presents a somewhat false economy as the problems that arise due to language, cultural and time zones differences often make the promised raw cost savings quickly evaporate.

As a matter of fact, companies who outsourced their IT development in the last decade had realised that they had created a long-term pain. They become reliant on the outsourcer who has built their applications, owns their code and can charge a premium for any maintenance or enhancements that need to be made.

As a matter of fact, recent research by Deloitte showed a reversal of the outsourcing trend and that 48 per cent of respondents had terminated the outsourcing agreement early.

Outsourcing is not a silver bullet to the skills shortage issue. Instead, businesses should look to retain the people and resources that are differentiating them in the market and providing competitive advantage. The more enlightened organisations are now looking to hold on to the ‘brain side’ of IT and only continue to outsource commodity IT. 

As IT departments continue to struggle to do more with less, the IT skills shortage rumbles on. So what should organisations be doing today to address short-term requirements?

Here are a couple of thoughts:

Understand where and when to automate - with 80 per cent of IT spend still focused on ‘keeping the lights on’, freeing developers from low level, low value technical tasks will raise productivity and improve business efficiency.
Leverage outside resource where it makes sense - while at the same time ensuring that you don’t become dependent on outsourcing relationships where you can be held to ransom.
Invest in staff training - ensure that your staff are equipped and able to cope with the demands of the business and skilled to build innovative applications.

The higher-paying occupation that has produced the most jobs post-recession: Software developer (applications and systems software). Since 2010, 104,348 jobs have been added (11% growth). In total, 1,042,402 people are currently employed as software developers in the U.S., earning an average hourly pay of $45.06.

“Companies want to go to market first with innovations; they want to capitalize on mobile and cloud technologies; they want to extract, parse and apply Big Data to to make smarter business decisions and create better solutions for clients,” Ferguson says. “Software developers play a key role in these initiatives.”

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most software developers work for computer systems design and related services firms or software publishers. Others work in computer and electronic product manufacturing industries. They typically have a bachelor’s degree in computer science.</p>

Put simply, the chasm between supply and demand is leaving the UK short of the specialist skills needed to drive the digital media economy, innovation and export.

Michael Gove MP has finally responded to Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s criticism that the UK focuses on teaching how to use software rather than how it’s made, and we’re due to see Computer Science roll-out in the 2014 curriculum. 

However, the launch of this ‘Year of Code’ by the government was met with a degree of scepticism and resentment. Whilst it is good to drive young interest, perhaps telling the world we’re going to get kids coding is seen as devaluing the profession itself. Either way, the fact remains that 90% of the population doesn't understand or can’t code.

This year pupils will learn code from Year 1 and by Key Stage 3 are expected to be proficient in more than two programming languages and apply them to creative projects. Brilliant!  But there are a few big issues. 

A survey by MyKindaCrowd found 74% of ICT teachers don’t think they have the skills to teach computer science and 69% feel the government won’t provide enough support to deliver the subject.  In fact, many schools don’t have an ICT specialist teacher. Is this chicken and egg? Cart before horse? Or simply really poor planning, great in theory but flawed in practice?

Overseas, primary schools in Estonia have already successfully introduced computer programming lessons into the weekly timetable and anyone who knows first-hand how passionate young children feel about apps and handheld devices recognises that this as a huge opportunity to inspire them early.

Yes, we need to inspire youngsters in the creative language of the future, coding, but we must do it in a way that is relevant and appropriate to business, making students as ‘work ready’ as the education system can. 

Indeed, members of the Corporate IT Forum have suggested there is too much focus on coding within the new curriculum and that there should be greater breadth to the subject. 

After all, team work is at the core of agile development and the government is looking for a more code informed society from the younger generation up. And that is what we need, a generation of coders with business acumen to drive our future prosperity.    

With the government’s equal focus on bridging the gap between education and the commercial world through supported apprenticeships, surely there are already processes in place to really harness the commercial and education alliance? 

This could deliver support for the 96% of teachers who welcome business help to hone their computer science teaching skills and knowledge at the same time as giving industry what it wants; work-ready individuals and more of them, fast.  

The technology industry itself moves rapidly and new languages become legacy in the same way that IT products have a lifecycle and this presents even more reason for the education and commercial worlds to pool resources and experience. 

If teachers don’t feel confident delivering lessons, why not bring industry in to help do the job? Ultimately it’s our collective futures that stand to benefit, even if it means adopting new methods of direct hands-on teaching and working together.

Coding is a highly-skilled occupation, which can’t be learnt overnight- and we shouldn’t pretend otherwise. Professionals will tell you they are learning every day because the industry is constantly adapting and evolving. This is part of its attraction.

We would all be naive to expect society to be confident in its knowledge and ability to code within a couple of years. This is why ‘The Year of Code’ should be reworked and renamed the ‘Generation of Code’ since this initiative should be regarded as a long-term plan to ensure our country’s skills grow at a healthy rate, alongside the industry’s desire to expand, rather than a quick fix and a headline.

We have a recession busting growth sector that cannot find skilled workers, a generation that needs to be inspired, a government that must prove its credentials in education and a computer science community that has the desire to share knowledge. Why aren’t we all working together to make this happen?

<p>This is in a software/internet marketplace where women are online in equal numbers to men, directly or indirectly influence 61% of consumer electronics purchases, generate 58% of online dollars, and represent 42% of active gamers. Women avoid careers in software due to hostile environments, unsustainable pace, diminished sense of purpose, disadvantages in pay, and lack of advancement, peers or mentors. Agile Software Development is founded upon values that challenge such dysfunction in order to build self-organizing, collaborative and highly productive teams. In a high functioning Agile practice, developers engage each other, product owners and sponsors in a shared concern for quality, predictability and meeting the needs of end users. Can Agile values and practice drive changes in the workplace to better attract and retain women software developers?</p>

<p>http://www.techvibes.com/blog/women-in-tech-addressing-the-shortage-of-women-in-stem-jobs-2014-06-25
The problem with this is that while our world remains reliant on STEM, those engaged in its development continue to be narrowly dominated by men. Why is this the case, and what can be done about it?

On June 16 ScribbleLive and Georgian Partners co-hosted a chat on the shortage of women in the essential STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) career fields. ScribbleLive was joined by Cecily Carver, co-director of Dames Making Games; Tendu Yogurtcu, VP Engineering at Syncsort; Jen Lamere, a 17-year-old who won the TVnext Hackathon; Laura Plant, Director at Ladies Learning Code; and Mélanie Attia, Director of Digital Marketing at Silanis Technology, who all offered their views on the key issues that surround the gender imbalance in STEM jobs.

Among the most significant difficulties identified in convincing women to consider STEM careers is tech’s long-held image as being boring and dry. Cecily Carver felt this perception of tech is a big part of it, especially when so many people are told to choose a career by following their passion – “what we don’t always talk about is how technology connects to our passions."

Deeper issues relating to confidence, and willingness to fail in non-traditional careers for women were also considered deterrents. Cecily Carver noted that something not often talked about is how much of programming involves failure, frustration, stuff not working and feeling lost. “If you’re already having confidence issues or facing subtle undermining from your colleagues, this becomes really difficult to deal with."

Lack of identifiable role models was also deemed to be a problem. School teachers were deemed to be the most critical influences, but too often they were not passionate enough about technology. Laura Plant said the lack or tech-savvy teachers is definitely a huge gap and part of this challenge. “How can you inspire when you aren’t inspired yourself?” Mélanie Attia felt the answer lay in empowering teachers to inspire children to discover the world with STEM. “They need to build context and interest in how the world works, teach how to ask good questions, how to challenge, and how to think critically."


Things to consider - women only tech events?

This seems to be the agenda of a lot of tech organisations (especially the big ones and I'm going to jump into the case of Google shortly). This blog will focus on women in tech, or rather, "<strong>lack</strong> of women in tech" and why this is/has been a problem and what this means for the future of the tech industry. And society.  

The BLS expects a 30% increase in the number of software developers by 2020 (from 2010).</p>
