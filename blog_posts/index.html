			<h2>There ain't no party like an ASOS party</h2>

			<h3>THREE REASONS WHY I LOVE ASOS. IN NO ORDER</h3>
			<ol class="reasons_list">
			<li><strong>It's like reading a fashion magazine.</strong> But without killing a tree.  
			<li><strong>The catwalk videos.</strong> These help ASOS sell their stuff. Accompanied by funky catwalk music and size 8 models makes for a good purchasing mood and optimistic future hot-self. Adds another dimension, enhances the decision making process for the buyer, and for the seller (ASOS)a blatant sales technique.
			<li><strong>Purchasing on ASOS is a total breeze.</strong> As per the many an ASOS item residing in my house, including the mini  playsuit collection stuffed in the back of my wardrobe probably covered in mothballs (sometimes you make a bung buy). Purchasing on ASOS is a total breeze. It is so simple and easy it makes you want to buy more stuff.

			<h3>THREE REASONS WHY I LOVE AIRBNB</h3>
				<ol class="reasons_list">
					<li><strong>Solves my problem.</strong> I need a place to stay. And I find one. Like STAT (well not all the time, sometimes I get distracted looking at the pretty interiors and imagine "one day when I'm a millionaire I will collect this house, and this condo and.."). I get bored of hotels. This is a nice alternative. Often cheaper too. It's great when travelling with a toddler. I can customise my search to be the "entire place". I'm not going to feel bad if I have to run out the door and there are dirty nappies on the floor to greet housekeeping with (I have done this on many an occasion and I feel the guilt) I can deal with that shit (literally) in my own time, not someone elses. Me me meeeee.</li>
					<li><strong>Feels genuine.</strong> Operates on honesty. Makes you want to be a better thoughtful human who treats their accommodation respectfully. At the end of the day this is someone else's home/livelihood/efforts (vs above example pooey nappy on floor). You abide by the houserules, and if you are a great guest you'll get rave reviews and vice versa. If you're a host naturally you want 5 star ratings. Lifts the bar, generates culture of "how to wow/exceed expectations" - how can we do this better, how can we be better people. Deep!</li>
					<li><strong>Usability. Duh!</strong> The whole point of this Dev Academy exercise. It has a clean homepage with a focus on reservation, not sign up. Action before registration. You feel like you are getting value out of the site. The subtle word choice of <em>"Find a place to stay"</em> tells us what <strong>we can do</strong> and not what their site does. Easy navigation and click throughs. Great search filters. You can even select a treehouse. One day I'm going to do it.</li>
				</ol>



			<h2 id="fan">Converse for life!</h2>
				
				<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.converse.com/"><img class="photo" src="http://wallpaperwonder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Converse-Shoes-HD-Wallpaper.jpg"></a></div>

			<h3>THREE REASONS WHY I'M DRAWN TO THE CONVERSE SITE</h3>
				<ol class="reasons_list">
					<li><strong>I love cons.</strong> I used to be a stiletto wearing corporate snob, literally looking down (I'm kinda tall) on those "not of the heel variety appreciation club". Yep. I was a jerk (correction, jerk with sore back). Nowadays I get my fashion kicks from cowboy boots...and surprise surprise the formerly dreaded sneaker. Now I love my cons. I wear them all the time. I can't imagine my life without them. I think what I'm talking about here in case you aren't able to read between the lines, or my mind for that matter, is that stylization and identity are key things for me as a consumer and websites like ASOS and CONVERSE really play well to this. Air Bnb too. I'll explore this a bit more.</li>
					<li><strong>Customisation.</strong>This is the coolest ever feature. YOU CAN CUSTOMISE YOUR OWN SNEAKERS. You feel like your own designer. You are in charge (kind of, you have to work within the parameters.
