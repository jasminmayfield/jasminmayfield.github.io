			<h2>There ain't no party like an ASOS party</h2>

			<p>I love ASOS.<br>
			It's my (well deserved) "time out". Indulging in ASOS is like reading a fashion mag.<br>In fact it's whole look and feel is much the same as a magazine - with multiple text sizes and fonts and big bright images depicting "fun," in it's various forms. Notably, the ASOS "celebrity lookbooks" provide you with outfits similar to the celebrity flavour of the month.<br>
			<em>"Are you tired of not looking cool?"<br>
			"How would you feel if you dressed like Jennifer Anniston?"<br>
			"If you buy this and match it with this then you are high class and sophisticated and pretty much the bees knees"<br>
			"Come be high class and cool with us, here at ASOS."</em><br>
			<em>Aaaaaaand</em> yes. It more or less works everytime I'm on the site and feeling rich.<br>
			Aside from left wondering how my wardrobe got so ugly (and why I am not famous yet) there's a reason why ASOS is one of the largest online clothing retailers. 

			So what do they do well?<br>In my eyes they've really nailed the user experience from homepage to purchase.(Proven as per the many an ASOS item residing in my house, including the mini  playsuit collection stuffed in the back of my wardrobe probably covered in mothballs - sometimes you make a bung buy) Purchasing on ASOS is a total breeze. It is so simple and easy it makes you want to buy more stuff. This begins on the homepage, greeted by a bunch of 20 something year olds gayly jumping on what looks to be a beach, probably on holiday somewhere warm in their new ASOS gears. Divs are everywhere. What could be displayed as "clutter" is actually really simple and clean. Content is compartmentalised. Everywhere! It's alluring and effective as we continue to click through the sale section (ASOS is always on sale, another reason I love it) or any section that grabs us. (Colours, fonts, cool funky borders, fun shapes all work their magic to hold our attention) Whichever path you take leads you to a simple item display accompanied with an efficient search feature - we can refine our search via size, colour, price range, brand, even style of dress e.g. "skater dress". They even seacrh via "occassion" now - I just came across a "What to wear to that next wedding". Brilliant!! Such a good idea. ASOS have an insanely high inventory so the ability to specify is awesome. Shortlisting/wish listing is easy, just a simple click that's stored in your personal repository, and if you want to see how a garment "wears" just watch the accompanying catwalk video (further accompanied with cool catwalk music).<br>

			5 adjectives that spring to mind when I'm looking at ASOS's website design are elegant, simple, fun, alluring and effective. 5 adjectives to describe the content or function of the site include fun, impulsive, indulgent, deserving and fashionable. Collectively these form a pretty cool identity, and I the driver with fashion is that you create your own identity and style through what you wear. This site is very much about identity, yes you can take the "follow the leader" path with the celebrity style lookbook but I also feel on the flip side that individuality is given a place, and you can see this through the wide and varied looks and styles that ASOS promotes.<br>

			When you look at the homepage image your eyes are drawn to the main image of the gang on the beach, simply through sheer size (dominates the page) and the vivid play with colour. When you look at the page from afar, focus shifts to its adjacent text that simply reads "<em><strong>T  H  I  S     I  S    A  S  O  S. Your one stop fashion destination"</strong></em>. Image + text = theme. Well done ASOS. You could spend hours perusing ASOS. If you have a set agenda and you know what you want chances are you'll come out winning. On the flipside if you don't have an agenda and this is purely bumming around online it's understandable if you come away feeling like you've lost your life trawling the pages. (This happens to me a lot because I procrastinate and avoid doing my real work) But 9 times out of 10 you'll win. ASOS has made it so you will feel like you're winning, which in reality - THEY are really winning, so you're probably both winning. And it's win-win.<br>

			If I haven't made it clear by now, ASOS solves the problem of "I need to buy something". It does this, in my opinion super well. I haven't even covered their SELL or MARKETPLACE features yet! </p>

			<h2 id="fan">Converse for life!</h2>
			<p>The converse website really feels like a shop. It doesn't have the exploratory lifestyle magazine feel that ASOS does.
