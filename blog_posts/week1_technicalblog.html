			<h2>There ain't no party like an ASOS party</h2>

			<h3>THREE REASONS WHY I LOVE ASOS. IN NO ORDER</h3>
			<ol class="reasons_list">
				<li><strong>It's like reading a fashion magazine.</strong> But without killing a tree.</li>
				<li><strong>The catwalk videos.</strong> These help ASOS sell their stuff.Accompanied by funky catwalk music and size 8 models makes for a good purchasing mood and optimistic future hot-self. Adds another dimension, enhances the decision making process for the buyer, and for the seller (ASOS)a blatant sales technique.</li>
				<li><strong>Purchasing on ASOS is a total breeze.</strong> As per the many an ASOS item residing in my house, including the mini  playsuit collection stuffed in the back of my wardrobe probably covered in mothballs (sometimes you make a bung buy). Purchasing on ASOS is a total breeze. It is so simple and easy it makes you want to buy more stuff.</li>
			</ol>

				<strong>Summarise the site visually in 5 adjectives:</strong> Elegant, simple, fun, alluring and effective.<br>

				<strong>Summarise the content/function/purpose of the site in 5 adjectives:</strong>Fun, high-fashion, affordable, indulgent, commercial.<br>

				<strong>Website flow:</strong> When you look at the homepage image your eyes are drawn to the main image of the gang on the beach. When you look at the page from afar your focus shifts to the adjacent text that reads<br> "<em><strong>T  H  I  S     I  S    A  S  O  S. Your one stop fashion destination"</strong></em>. The remainder of the homepage is content heavy however the overall visual effect is simple and tidy. Content is compartmentalised which makes it easy to navigate the many sections and this approach is carried through the entire site. Again, like a magazine you can quickly jump to your preferred section and quickly locate what you need. The search refinement tool makes this easy - we can refine our search via size, colour, price range, brand, even style of dress e.g. "prom dress".<br>

				<strong>Overall?: </strong>Disappointment may occur if you come up for air with an empty basket. But chances are you'll be satisfied in some way, purchase or not. The ASOS brand is about providing quality high-class clothing that's affordable and fashionable. Their "celebrity look-books" play into this, generating demand and ultimately sales. Overall it's a comprehensive but visually cohesive site that's highly navigatable and alluring. Probably why I keep coming back here.

			<h2>Air BnB (is where I wanna beeeee)</h2>

			<h3>THREE REASONS WHY I LOVE AIRBNB</h3>
				<ol class="reasons_list">
					<li><strong>Solves my problem.</strong> I need a place to stay. And I find one. Like STAT (well not all the time, sometimes I get distracted looking at the pretty interiors and imagine "one day when I'm a millionaire I will collect this house, and this condo and.."). I get bored of hotels. This is a nice alternative. Often cheaper too. It's great when travelling with a toddler. I can customise my search to be the "entire place". I'm not going to feel bad if I have to run out the door and there are dirty nappies on the floor to greet housekeeping with (I have done this on many an occasion and I feel the guilt) I can deal with that shit (literally) in my own time, not someone elses. Me me meeeee.</li>
					<li><strong>Feels genuine.</strong> Operates on honesty. Makes you want to be a better thoughtful human who treats their accommodation respectfully. At the end of the day this is someone else's home/livelihood/efforts (vs above example pooey nappy on floor). You abide by the houserules, and if you are a great guest you'll get rave reviews and vice versa. If you're a host naturally you want 5 star ratings. Lifts the bar, generates culture of "how to wow/exceed expectations" - how can we do this better, how can we be better people. Deep!</li>
					<li><strong>Usability. Duh!</strong> The whole point of this Dev Academy exercise. It has a clean homepage with a focus on reservation, not sign up. Action before registration. You feel like you are getting value out of the site. The subtle word choice of <em>"Find a place to stay"</em> tells us what <strong>we can do</strong> and not what their site does. Easy navigation and click throughs. Great search filters. You can even select a treehouse. One day I'm going to do it.</li>
				</ol>

			<p>
				<strong>Summarise the site visually in 5 adjectives:</strong> Slick, captivating, familiar, unique, friendly/homely. 

				<strong>Summarise the content/function/purpose of the site in 5 adjectives:</strong> Friendly/homely, diverse, informative, quality, trustworthy.<br>

				<strong>Website flow:</strong> Really intuitive. Simple flow from start to finish. Homepage invites you to enter your destination (with suggestions that autopop as you type), your check-in and check-out date and number of travellers. It's pretty easy to find what you are looking for using the search filters - lots of built in options including "tree-house" as an accommodation option!<br>

				<strong>Overall?</strong>The homepage is clean with a focus on reservation, not sign-up registration, making you feel like you are getting value out of the site. The word choice of "Find a place to stay" tells us what we can do, and not what their site does and as an AirBnb browser this makes you feel well considered. The values of reliance and trust are essential to AirBnb's philosophy and survival, creating a type of online community that is "safe" and who are respectful in both residing but also accomodating guests. Regulating this is done via reviews and feedback through the site. You are made to feel like you have lots of options and choice with Airbnb. It doesn't have the pretentiousness that sometimes hotels have and because you are dealing with people with high ratings (generally) who wish to sustain them you generally receive a more personable, quality experience which makes for a great holiday in my eyes!

			<h2 id="fan">Converse for life!</h2>
				
				<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.converse.com/"><img class="photo" src="http://wallpaperwonder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Converse-Shoes-HD-Wallpaper.jpg"></a></div>

			<h3>TWO REASONS WHY I'M DRAWN TO THE CONVERSE SITE</h3>
				<ol class="reasons_list">
					<li><strong>I love cons.</strong> I used to be a stiletto wearing corporate snob, literally looking down (I'm kinda tall) on those "not of the heel variety appreciation club". Yep. I was a jerk (correction, jerk with sore back). Nowadays I get my fashion kicks from cowboy boots...and surprise surprise the formerly dreaded sneaker. Now I love my cons. I wear them all the time. I can't imagine my life without them.</li>
					<li><strong>Customisation.</strong>This is the coolest ever feature. YOU CAN CUSTOMISE YOUR OWN SNEAKERS. You feel like your own designer. You are in charge (kind of, you have to work within the parameters). </li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					<strong>Summarise the site visually in 5 adjectives:</strong> Creative, colorful, adaptive, simple, relaxed.<br>

					<strong>Summarise the content/function/purpose of the site in 5 adjectives:</strong> Creative, colorful, adaptive, simple, relaxed. Yep. Same as above!<br>

					<strong>Website flow:</strong> Strong visual emphasis on the homepage inviting you customise a sneaker. This takes you into their customisation platform where you are free to play. It's very easy to use, simply pick a style of sneaker, then its just a matter of clicking on the various parts of the shoe and selecting your preferred colour. So easy. SOOOO easy. Shipping costs are outlined BAM pretty much eye level on the homepage. This is important. Well considered there, Converse! The site is also a standard retail site, with a very basic layout of sneaker styles, patterns and colors. It's clear the emphasis is on the shoe customisation.<br>

					<strong>Overall? </strong> Converse are all about personalisation and creating your own identity through their footwear. You are made to feel like you are free and creative. They have a simple website to contain what really are endless possibilities for sneaker customisation. So I think their site has been designed very much with this in mind, it's tidy, easy to navigate and interact with.
