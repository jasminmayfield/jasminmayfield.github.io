			<h2>Sunday June 8th, 2014.<br>Enspiral Dev Academy. Phase Zero. Week One. Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>

			<h3>Thoughts and reflections in no set order:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Well I do love a good fireside chat.</strong> This was more or less a reiterator/harsh reminder of what I've jumped into. I really loved Shereef's chat. I think I just really like Shereef really. Smart guy, took a risk and now it's a revolution. So inspiring and cool! Overall the video was a mixture of die-hard inspiration - makes me really want to be an amazing developer but this is also mixed with sheer doubt and feeling super vulnerable. And quite stupid cos I don't feel like I know anything being a total newbie. I guess overall it was reassuring that we are all in this together and the sense of community is strong. I'm looking forward to being a part of the team and a part of the community and helping and giving. I know for absolute certainty I myself will need a lot of help/king-size blocks of chocolate/wine/other rewards to get me through the next few months.</li>  
				<li><strong>BRING IT, I say!</strong> This course is all about attitude. I've found myself several times a day focusing on being positive and really celebrating my wins (no matter how minor they are) and appreciating that although I may be out of my depth and learning slower than the pace of the world's slowest snail, I am still in fact learning. I have moments when my brain physically hurts from problem-solving but this is really cool and something to be acknowledged positively because it means something is changing up there and I'm hoping it's for the better!</li>
				<li><strong>This is a bootcamp.</strong> Bootcamps are short and sharp. Maximum input, maximum output. So this week was a little bit like pushing 50 skycrapers up a really steep mountain. Timeboxing is the hardest for me. I seem to take forever at doing things. Must get quicker. Bootcamps are short so I don't have the time to fluff. I need to stop perfecting things and just meet the brief and if I have time leftover THEN come back. My plan for next week is to start with the exercises/challenges and then work backwards.</li>
